        Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) studies how humans interact with computer systems
        and how interfaces can be designed to be usable, efficient, and satisfying.
        Understanding human memory is essential because interfaces should not overload
        the user’s cognitive capacity.

        Sensory memory briefly holds visual and auditory information, short-term memory
        holds a limited number of items for active tasks, while long-term memory stores
        information permanently. Miller’s Law explains that users can remember only about
        seven items at a time, which is why chunking information improves usability.

        UI focuses on the visual elements of a system, whereas UX focuses on the overall
        experience and feelings of the user while interacting with the system.

        Interaction in HCI is viewed as a form of communication between humans and machines.
        Systems must be designed so that users can easily express intentions and understand
        system responses.

        Cognitive skills involve thinking, decision-making, and memory, while motor skills
        involve physical actions such as typing or clicking. Designers must consider both
        when creating interfaces. Chunking and memory limits help designers present
        information in manageable pieces to reduce cognitive load.

        Norman’s Action Cycle explains how users interact with systems by forming goals,
        executing actions, and evaluating results. The Gulf of Execution refers to the
        difficulty users face in translating goals into actions, while the Gulf of
        Evaluation refers to difficulty in understanding system feedback.

        Good interface design minimizes these gulfs by providing clear actions and
        understandable feedback. Miller’s Law further guides designers to reduce memory
        demands by limiting choices and grouping information.

        Prototyping allows designers to test ideas before final implementation.
        Low-fidelity prototypes are simple and quick, while high-fidelity prototypes
        closely resemble the final system.

        Design principles such as visibility, feedback, and consistency help users
        understand how a system works. Well-designed interactive systems support user
        control, prevent errors, and provide meaningful feedback.
